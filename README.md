# Algorithm-for-File-Updates-in-Pyton

## Project Description
I developed a Python script to update an access control list based on employee IP addresses. This script ensured that only authorized personnel could access sensitive patient records by maintaining an up-to-date allow list.

## Open the File that Contains the Allow List

```python
# Assign the file name to a variable
import_file = "allow_list.txt"

# Use a with statement to open the file and ensure it is properly closed after the block of code
with open(import_file, 'r') as file:
    # The file is now open and can be accessed using the file variable

Explanation: The with statement is used to open a file, assigning it to a variable file. The mode 'r' indicates the file is open for reading. The file is automatically closed after the indented block of code is executed.

# Read the contents of the file into a string
ip_addresses = file.read()

Explanation: file.read() reads the content of the file and stores it in the variable ip_addresses as a string.

# Convert the string of IP addresses into a list
ip_list = ip_addresses.split('\n')

Explanation: ip_addresses.split('\n') splits the string ip_addresses into a list where each element is a line from the file (assuming each IP address is on a new line).

# Assuming remove_list is defined elsewhere and contains IP addresses to remove
for element in remove_list:
    # This loop will iterate over each IP address that needs to be removed

Explanation: The for loop iterates through each element in remove_list.

if element in ip_list:
    ip_list.remove(element)

Explanation: Inside the loop, the code checks if element (the current IP address to remove) is in the list ip_list. If it is, ip_list.remove(element) removes the IP address from the list. There are no duplicates in ip_list, so it is safe to call .remove() without additional checks

# Convert the list back into a string, each IP address on a new line
ip_addresses_string = '\n'.join(ip_list)

# Open the file in write mode to update it
with open(import_file, 'w') as file:
    file.write(ip_addresses_string)

Explanation: '\n'.join(ip_list) combines the list of IP addresses into a single string, each IP address separated by a newline character. Opening the file in 'w' mode allows writing the updated list back to the file.

This Python algorithm automates the process of updating an IP allow list for a company's restricted subnetwork. It involves reading IP addresses from a file, comparing them to a removal list, and then writing the updated list back to the same file. Key operations include file I/O, string manipulation, and list iteration.
